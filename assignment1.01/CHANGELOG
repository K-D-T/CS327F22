Project should meet specs
By Kenyon...
I have to start pushing this to git more often, I haven't generated a proper changelog. So I'll give an approximate breakdown

What was completed day 1?

Constants for size of the field,
structs for door(exits)
struct for map, holds char field, and doors
struct for location of pokemart & pokemon center
build borders, print function, init field
create exit, initially just placed them in array, but changed to add them to struct to save time later
validatelocation to stop collision of pokemart/pokecenter
build pokestructs to build the locations

What was completed  Day2
buildLongGrass designed and test randomly generate the location and ensure
isthereSpace, checks to ensure there is no collision with other objects
isEnoughSpace, a redundant function to do the same thing as isThereSpace but with a different structure


Lost track of Day to Day additions
generatePaths used to create paths, while
additionalPaths adds connections to markets and centers
buildTerrain create additional trees and boulders
buildclearings used to fill up the map
