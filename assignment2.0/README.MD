read me for assignment 2.0

I decided to start over because pokemon, just wasn't working out for me, I ran into some memory issues, that didn't make much sense,
so it was time to scrap the project and start on something I'm interested in... CHESS

using some of the standards we developed over the semester, a char board and a list of moves, we can also use a few different boards,
 so that both players have an equivalent view

So, I've built several functions for logic, wasn't able to complete checkmate feature, working on the logic for "King Vision"
the idea was to locate the opposite King after a move  and then check all paths to ensure he couldn't move/ no one could block to defend.

SO many functions, a lot harder when there are no specs, you're designing everytime an idea pops up into your head.
